# Goal
The goal is to provide all beginners (like us) with the resources to build their first neural network from scratch.

# Prerequisites
I'd rather redirect you to some incredible resources that already exist than trying to re-explain everything. If you go through the links you should feel comfortable with the explanations into the code

- 3B1B neural networks series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi  
- Michael Nielsen's book (best explanations found beginner): http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
- Book by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/

If you are not familiar with multivariable calculus check some videos from one of these series:
